## Best-fit situations and problems solved

An everyday photograph can hold a compelling pose or relationship yet lose its focus to an ordinary composition and a busy background. **Panel 121** preserves photographic identity, extracts the most recognisable subject, and rebuilds it through relaxed marker-like doodles, edited handwriting, and exceptionally abundant whitespace.

### Best for

- Turning people, everyday objects, and lifestyle scenes into independent-magazine or lifestyle editorial illustrations.
- Preserving contour, pose, and narrative relationships while removing most background and secondary objects.
- Combining the ease of naïve drawing with mature control of graphics, text, and empty space.
- Consistent top-bottom, left-right, design-only, multi-ratio, wallpaper, or directory-batch delivery.

### What it solves

- Subtraction, rearrangement, cropping, and scale changes give ordinary photographs a new visual focus.
- Graphics and text share an invisible grid, visual axes, and reading path instead of a sentence stacked over a person.
- Small graphic forms let whitespace create distance, pauses, and breathing room without scattered filler icons.
- Comparisons keep exactly two 50:50 regions and generate directly from the current original, preventing third bands and second stylisation passes.

## Original prompt · five languages

[简体中文](references/original-prompt/zh-CN.md) · [English](references/original-prompt/en.md) · [日本語](references/original-prompt/ja.md) · [한국어](references/original-prompt/ko.md) · [العربية](references/original-prompt/ar.md)

The Chinese file preserves the user's original prompt verbatim and is the sole runtime creative and aesthetic authority. The other four files are complete, faithful reading translations and never rewrite the generation instructions.

**Signature:** naïve lifestyle illustration · marker/crayon/oil-pastel texture · invisible grid · integrated image–text composition · light natural handwriting · source-derived limited palette · exceptionally abundant whitespace

## Quick fit check

| What you need to know | What Panel 121 gives you |
|---|---|
| An ordinary photographic composition? | Redirects position, cropping, and scale while keeping the most recognisable relationships. |
| Will doodles feel childish? | Pairs naïve drawing with mature composition, avoiding children's scrapbooks, cheap cartoons, and templates. |
| Is text always centred? | Uses contours, movement, shoulder lines, and negative space to create asymmetric relationships. |
| Flexible delivery? | Four modes, common ratios, exact pixels, and isolated directory batches. |

## Transformation logic

```text
understand subject and narrative → remove most background → simplify into relaxed marker-like forms → rework scale and cropping → establish an invisible grid and reading path → place minimal handwriting → finish the rhythm with exceptional whitespace
```

## Recognisable finished traits

- The photographic region retains identity, structure, pose, natural lighting, and colour atmosphere with only subtle grading.
- Simplified symbolic forms use slightly shaky, interrupted, imperfect lines; colour overshoots, exposed paper, and handmade errors are welcome.
- Complete perspective and fine realism yield to active removal of background and irrelevant objects.
- Small subjects sit off-centre, near edges, suspended, or partially cropped; empty space shapes positive/negative forms and distances.
- Image and text form one composition; light natural handwriting varies in width and pressure while spacing stays editorially controlled.
- Soft, bright, limited colours come from the source; warm white or an extremely pale mixed hue creates broad breathing space.

## Four output modes

- `top-bottom`: exactly two full-width regions, reality above and design below, 50% each.
- `left-right`: exactly two full-height regions, reality left and design right, 50% each; it never rotates into a top-bottom layout.
- `design-only`: the full canvas contains only Panel 121's designed translation; the photograph remains a non-visible reference.
- `wallpaper-pack`: creates complete artworks for phone, iPad, desktop, and watch, either `linked` as a coherent family or `independent` as four separate works.

Modes and sizes may be combined. Supported sizes include `1:1`, `3:4`, `4:3`, `4:5`, `5:4`, `2:3`, `3:2`, `9:16`, `16:9`, `21:9`, `5:7`, `7:5`, and exact pixels. Text can be prompt-generated, user-exact, or absent. A directory is inventoried recursively and every source is isolated while sharing one set of delivery settings; final PNG files remain flat in one fresh task directory.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nevertoday/xxd-panel-121.git
npx skills add https://github.com/nevertoday/xxd-panel-121 --skill xxd-panel-121
```

Restart the agent session after installation, then invoke `$xxd-panel-121`. Add `--global --agent codex --yes` when a user-level Codex installation is wanted.

Common examples:

```text
/xxd-panel-121 photo.jpg --mode top-bottom --size 3:4 --text prompt --locale en-US
/xxd-panel-121 photo.jpg --mode left-right --size 16:9 --text prompt --locale en-US
/xxd-panel-121 photo.jpg --mode design-only --size 9:16 --text none
/xxd-panel-121 ./photos --mode design-only --size auto,3:4 --text prompt --locale ja-JP
```
